# Traffic Lights
This program is going to improve the traffic light for assisting people with visual impairment.
While the red and yellow signals are running, a sound/music will come out. There is a control 
button to control the sound. People simply press the control button to hear and know what traffic 
light is running now. They can press the button again to pause the sound.All objects in the project
are made by three-dimension.
